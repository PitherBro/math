# Disclaimer ü§öÔ∏è 
    This will update many times
<br>
Like with any project you can't help but be a little safe.<br>
Not everyithing in here will be done by tommorrow, but it is all within my scope.
<br>

***
UI skills are low, Hence the AI.<br>
üòÆ‚Äçüí®Ô∏è if only i had time to focus more on sheek.
- upside though, it's like tutoring all over again.
- small steps, easy examples.

***
Again, <strong>AI</strong> is only handling the <strong>UI</strong> for <strong>HTML</strong>,<br>
I have to üõ†Ô∏è some of it to make it work, and will probably meld it more into my own thing.

# General Outlines üëáÔ∏è

## The launchpad of the program and it's general steps
- redirect current modules to the main starting point.
- steps
- - set/read a config file constants/variables
    - determine arg values on first run
      - we'll be Agile-ing this
  - check gitHub for updates - extra for now, we're not that big

# progLoop
## the main loop of the program
- console command line math function takes arguments from an HTML UI interface, or the console.
  - console works, it asks for a number of times to make a random selection
  - files are deposited into /db/3x+1/saves, will update path when more relevant.
  - need to add abilty to choose a number
  - add multi threading on a # of threads = # cores on system
  
 - need to further unify html with python
 - add menu to run diffrent functions/simulations

# plotGraph
- does what it says simply.
  - takes obj contained in save folders.
  - console can launch all, do not do with a lot in there
  - console can launch a single selection.
  - add as an option with it's own menu
  - compress into a class
